## BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING

Improving traffic safety is a major concern for any metropolitan city. In 2018 alone, there were 36,560 car crash related fatalities that occurred within the U.S. In order to counter and help eliminate car crash fatalities, initiatives such as Vision Zero have been taken up. A number of cities such as New York City and Chicago have followed this initiative within their cities to help promote traffic safety. The core concept behind this initiative is that traffic crashes are preventable and even one life lost is far too many.

My purpose in this project was to design a predictive model that would be able to analyze the primary causes for car crashes. Being able to design a model that can accurately predict the main cause for an incident occurring will allow the city to effectively act against it. If we know the cause for an incident, a city can then plan appropriately as to what measures should be taken to prevent them from happening again. In this project, I will be looking at car crash data from the city of Chicago in order to build a predictive model for their causes as well as identify a number of trends from the incidents.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

In Chicago city many car accidents are occuring hence there is need to investigate the cause. I am tasked to build a classifier to predict the primary contributory cause of a car accident, given information about the car, the people in the car, the road conditions as data analysis is an essential activity for the city management, the police and the residents to learn how to mitigate the accidents.

## OBJECTIVES
The main Objective of this dataset is to:

a) Investigate the primary cause of the road accidents

b) Investigate the months when the road accidents occurs the most times.

c) To investigate the correlation between different causes of road accidents.


## DATA UNDERSTANDING
The Traffic Crashes data comes from the Chicago Data Portal, an open data source maintained by the city of Chicago. The dataset contains all traffic crashes that were reported by the police within the city limits. Linked to the crash dataset are two datasets corresponding to Vehicles and Persons involved in the crash. Each crash incident has a unique crash record ID and report number associated with it, which allows for cross-referencing on the dashboards provided for the datasets.

The Crashes dataset contains a number of details related to the incident, such as location/time information, conditions of the road and traffic safety device functionality. The most important detail available is the primary contributory cause for the crash as determined by the office who reported the crash.

## CONCLUSION
After Analysis of this dataset we have come to a conclusion that:

a) Most accidents happened in the year 2015

b) ILLNOIS  State had the most car accidents

c) There is a high correlation between weather condition and primary cause of accidents

d) K-NEAREST NEIGHBORS is the model we will use to evaluate our model because it performed better than other models.

e) Males caused more accidents compared to Females.

## RECOMMENDATIONS

After Analysis of this dataset we have come up with the following recommendations:

a) Educate the masses on road safety measures.

b) Encourage drivers to take actions that prevent accidents.

c) People should be discouraged from driving during bad weather conditions

d) People should be discouraged from using faulty vehicles.

e) Encourage the male gender and the young people to be careful in their driving.
